<h3>I love pickled beets.</h3>
<p>Ever since I was a very young child, I've loved pickled beets. In fact, I loved them SO much as a kid that my uncles would buy them for me on my birthday.</p>

<h3>I speak Spanish</h3>
<p>I majored in Spanish in college. I got to studied aboard twice in Morelia, Mich., Mexico.</p>

<h3>I hate drinking water</h3>
<p>I don't know why, but I cannot stand drinking plain water. My parents thought I would grow out of it as an adult, but I haven't. I have to use flavor drops in order to drink it!</p>
